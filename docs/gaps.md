# Known Gaps — S01–S20

Status as of 2026-09-12. Test suite: 332 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed.

All code and tests for implemented stages S01–S20 pass. The gaps below are the
reasons the remaining 3 tests are skipped rather than run — none are fixable
by code changes alone.

## 1. S04 — Real audio corpus incomplete

- **Spec requirement:** 8–10 real lecture recordings, varied conditions
  (front/back row, quiet/busy room, stationary/moving lecturer, discussion-heavy).
- **Current state:** corpus not yet recorded/collected.
- **Blocks:**
  - S06 ASR/embedding bake-off cannot produce a real WER benchmark.
  - `tests/test_asr_worker.py:146` — skipped, no real S06 held-out benchmark to compare against.
  - `tests/test_e2e_gate.py:268` — skipped, RTF<2.0 for a full 60-minute session
    can't be honestly measured without a real 60-minute fixture.
- **Fix:** record and consent the S04 corpus per spec, run the S06 bake-off in MLflow.

## 2. S20 — Diarisation model unavailable

- **Spec requirement:** pyannote.audio 3.x producing anonymous speaker tags.
- **Current state:** pyannote.audio deliberately not installed; its pretrained
  model is HuggingFace-gated and no `HF_TOKEN` is configured in `.env`.
- **Blocks:**
  - `tests/test_diarisation.py:201` — skipped, real multi-speaker diarisation
    on real audio can't run. Tag-assignment mechanism is instead verified via
    a synthetic backend (`test_speaker_tags_assigned_from_synthetic_segments`).
- **Fix:** obtain a HuggingFace token with access to the gated pyannote model,
  set `HF_TOKEN` in `.env`, install `pyannote.audio`.

## 3. GPU driver — resolved (2026-09-12)

- Was: `nvidia-smi` reported a driver/library version mismatch, blocking any
  GPU-dependent verification.
- Root cause: host reboot pending after a driver update; S02's Ansible
  playbook had never actually been run against this machine (placeholder
  inventory, no held package).
- Fix applied: host rebooted; driver confirmed at 580.178.04
  (`nvidia-driver-580-server-open`); Docker GPU passthrough verified against
  the S02-pinned CUDA 12.6 image; `docs/cuda-matrix.md`, `ansible/site.yml`,
  `ansible/inventory.yml` updated from the 560.x placeholder to match; driver
  held via `apt-mark hold` and pinned via `/etc/apt/preferences.d/nvidia-driver`.
- Residual: the 3 skips above still cite "GPU driver mismatch" in their skip
  messages — that text is now stale. The real blockers are #1 and #2 above.

## Not yet addressed

- Skip messages in `test_asr_worker.py`, `test_diarisation.py`, `test_e2e_gate.py`
  still reference the old GPU mismatch reasoning and should be updated to point
  at the corpus/token gaps instead.
- `ansible/inventory.yml` still has placeholder `ansible_host` / `ansible_user`
  values — the playbook has never been run against a real target host, only
  retrofitted to match this dev machine's driver version.
